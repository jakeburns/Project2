WDD 2019
D3  Project
Assigned March 14th - Due April 4th


It is time to create a d3 app to visualize a complex set of data.  Your instructor has provided you with a 
set of grades from a previous class.  You will create a web application that will illuminate what is happening 
within the course and show data in multiple different ways.  In particular I would like to easily see if there 
is a change in student performance during the semester.

The Syllabus for that class indicates that 
Quizzes are worth 15% of the grade
Homeworks are worth 15% of the grade
There are 2 tests, each worth 20% of the grade
The final is worth 30% of the grade

You should use d3, but unless you get explicit permission you may not use any other libraries.
